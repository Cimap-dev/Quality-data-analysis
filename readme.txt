Hi guys, I want to share with you all this folder in which you will find a file myfunc.py (a py file plenty of useful functions that I also exploited in the 04/09 exam call, fortunately with good results) and two word files (in italian) that are basically "instructions" to use myfunc.py, completed by other useful pieces of code, all divided by topic (eg. pca, control charts etc).
in addition there are solved exercises from past calls and my solutions of the 04/09 exam call using indeed myfunc.py.

if anyone has any questions feel free to ask me in private.
anyway, for those who will decide to use it:
- word files are designed to be used during the exam, so there are many "titles" repeated in a different way to allow me to search for the same code during the exam possibly with more than one keyword.
I also recommend using what is called "riquadro di spostamento" in word in Italian, which will be useful for searching for the pieces of code you need without using the keyword search.
- in the "exams ecc" folder I used myfunc.py but inside the folders of each individual exam you will find a different version of myfunc.py, the latest is the one outside the folders or inside the folder of the 04/09 call
